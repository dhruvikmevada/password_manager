# Password Manager CLI tool

Note: This version got outdated as soon as it released LOL. I had created this tool just for fun and for self. But, I got irritated by my own designed usage where I had to provide tons of input. Now, I am reworking on this to support command-line arguments which I think would be a better usage option. You must be wondering, why the hack this guy is creating command-line tool and not GUI based interactive. I like cli based tools more than GUI, but I would think about it and give it a try. Might get more easy to use. For now this is it.

Happy Coding!
